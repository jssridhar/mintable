# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Approach

Bootstrapped with create react app. Used tailwind, for css utilities.
Built out a very basic header/layout only for web (not mobile optimized).

Apporach was to have it feature complete first. Simulated an api to get list of tickets and draw ticket.
State, redux, actions and saga are in place. Drag n Drop hasn't been implemented and some loading states are also left out. But having these ui implemneted should be slightly easier given that the state is in place.
